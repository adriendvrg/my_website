<h1>How has the CPI and its components changed over the last few years?</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We can find <a href="https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843">CPI components at FRED</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the data we download is an index with various starting dates, we need to calculate the yearly, or 12-month change. To do this we need to use the <code>lag</code> function, and specifically, <code>year_change = value/lag(value, 12) - 1</code>; this means we are comparing the current monthâ€™s value with that 12 months ago lag(value, 12).</p></li>
