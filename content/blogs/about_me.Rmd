## MY PAST EXPERIENCES

My name is Adrien Duverger and I come from [*Paris*](https://www.paris.fr/) in **France**. Prior to attending the MFA at LBS I completed my undergraduate studies and a Master in Finance at Neoma  Business School in *Reims*. I have also had the opportunity to do several internships in Finance:

* My first internship was at Abn Amro Investment Solutions in *Paris* where I was a Quantitative Strategist and Portfolio Manager Summer Intern
* My second internship was a year-long work placement at Trust Ccompany of the West (TCW) in *New York*. There, I worked on a Relative Value portfolio as a Buy Side Equity Analyst.
* My last internship was at Goldman Sachs in *London* during the summer 2021. I interned there as an Equity Research Summer Analyst. 

After reading for the MFA 2022 at LBS, I will start working full time at Goldman Sachs as an Equity Research Analyst.


## HOBBIES
At LBS, I also had the opportunity to join the Wine and Spirits Club to organize tastings for wines, spirits and beers.

Also, I have several hobbies including boxing, skiing, motorbiking and reading about various subjects, including History.

Finally, I am also a travel enthusiast and have been to several countries including the US, Mexico, Cuba, South Africa, Croatia, Ukraine, Russia, Italy, Germany and many other European countries.
