<p>MY PAST EXPERIENCES</p>
<p>My name is Adrien Duverger and I come from <a href="https://www.paris.fr/"><em>Paris</em></a> in <em>France. Prior to attending the MFA at LBS I completed my undergraduate studies in Finance at Neoma Business School, </em>Reims*. I have also had the opportunity to do several internships in Finance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abn Amro Investment Solutions in <em>Paris</em></li>
<li>TCW in <em>Ne York</em></li>
<li>Goldman Sachs in <em>London</em></li>
</ul>
<p>After LBS, I will start working at Goldman Sachs as an Equity Research Analyst. I think learning R could help me be more efficient at doing some repetitive tasks and data analysis.</p>
