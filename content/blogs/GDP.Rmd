# GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

The % difference is really depending on the country, it is sometimes above 50% and sometimes even above 100% but for most data points it is real close to the real data point. 

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

We can see that both Germany and India have declining household expenditures, whereas the US is growing. Gross capital formation is somewhat stable for the US and slightly declining for Germany, whereas the investment into capital formation for India has spiked since the mid 2000s, reflecting the countries growth path. While India has a balance between exports and imports, Germany turned heavily towards being a net exporter since 2000, whereas the US has become a net importer. Going forward, one might expect India to turn more into a net exporter should globalization of supply chains pick up again. Germany, a saturated and stable net exporter, might want to consider starting investments into capital formation again instead of saving on all expenditures, as the economy is plateauing.
